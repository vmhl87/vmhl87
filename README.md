Hello! I'm Vincent Loh, a high school sophomore.

I do a lot of programming, these days mostly usaco-style contest programming.
A few years ago I used to spend a lot of time making (pretty bad) web games
with p5js, and I still occasionally make little animation projects.

C and C++ are the languages I primarily use, especially for contest programming.
I occasionally use Python or JS, and rarely Processing. Recently I've been
messing around with functional programming, and learning a bit of Haskell.

Hardware:

<summary><title>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (PC)</title>
	My primary computer is an AMD machine - Ryzen 5 2600 running Ubuntu.
	It has a pretty standard setup running Gnome.

	I dislike IDEs and primarily use a combination of nvim and tmux.
	I may in the future switch to an i3 on Debian setup similar to the
	one on my laptop.

<summary><title>Debian 12 (Laptop)</title>
	My choice of laptop is rather odd - it's a Lenovo ideapad 3 chromebook.
	
	With an Intel Celeron N4020 underclocked to 1.1GHz and Intel integrated
	graphics, its performance is far from good. However, combined with a
	pretty big battery, its battery life is very very good. I end up having
	to charge once every week or so, despite using it for school.

	A few months ago, I ran this laptop in "standard" chromeOS, doing most
	of my work in the VT2 virtual terminal emulator. (essentially a TTY)
	Recently I flashed a UEFI bootloader and installed Debian 12.

	Though I have i3 configured, I end up doing the majority of my work
	in the TTY, with a combination of nvim, tmux, and w3m.

Not a lot of my older projects are on my github. I have various web games
on [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/user/250345), most in various
stages of completeness.

You can contact me on Discord as `i.frame`!

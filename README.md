Hello! I'm Vincent Loh, a high school sophomore.

I do a lot of programming, these days mostly usaco-style contest programming.
A few years ago I used to spend a lot of time making (pretty bad) web games
with p5js, and still occasionally make little animation projects, like
[this one](https://github.com/vmhl87/simple-animation-framework).

[usaco](https://github.com/vmhl87/usaco) is probably my most active repo,
which I update every few days. I mantain a usaco repo with most of the work
I do in my [algorithm design](https://github.com/vmhl87/alg_design) class
at school. It has a bunch of random projects and notes.

C and C++ are the languages I primarily use, especially for contest programming.
Occasionally I use Python or JS, and rarely Processing. Recently I've been
messing around with functional programming and learning a bit of Haskell.

TODO: update this with new setup

My desktop is an AMD machine - Ryzen 5 2600 running Ubuntu.
It has a pretty standard setup running Gnome on Ubuntu 22.

I dislike IDEs and primarily use a combination of nvim and tmux.
I may in the future switch to an i3 on Debian setup similar to the
one on my laptop.

<details><summary>Laptop</summary>

My choice of laptop is rather odd - it's a Lenovo ideapad 3 chromebook.

With an Intel Celeron N4020 underclocked to 1.1GHz and Intel integrated
graphics, its performance is far from good. However, combined with a
pretty big battery, it gets a very high SOT. I end up having
to charge once every week or so, despite using it for school.

A few months ago, I ran this laptop in "standard" chromeOS, doing most
of my work in the VT2 virtual terminal emulator (essentially a TTY)
but I recently flashed a UEFI bootloader and installed Debian 12.

Though I have i3 configured, I end up doing the majority of my work
in the TTY, with a combination of nvim, tmux, and w3m.

<details><summary>Phone</summary>

I use a jailbroken iphone SE (first generation, from 2016) on iOS 13.4.1.
It has the clang toolchain and SDK installed, so I can (and sometimes do)
code on this device.

I used to use unc0ver v6.2.0, with the elu bootstrap, but recently I
switched to procursus on Odyssey.

I am not very good at Objective-C, but I have written a few tweaks -
for example [radianator](https://github.com/vmhl87/radianator).

Not a lot of my older projects are on my github. I have various web games
on [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/user/250345), most in various
stages of completeness.

I'm `i.frame` on Discord, feel free to contact me!

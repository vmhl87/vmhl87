Hello! I'm Vincent Loh, a high school senior.

I make various little projects here and there, and also enjoy competitive programming
(USACO, Codeforces, AtCoder). I also mantain [a little blog](https://vmhl87.github.io/starship)
that post to every so often (though not enough).

Hardware:

<details><summary>Desktop</summary>

AMD machine (Ryzen 5 2600) running Debian 12. Minimalistic i3 setup.

<details><summary>Laptop</summary>

I run a (former) celeron chromebook as my main laptop. It's now on debian 12,
with a similar minimal i3 setup. Additionally, I've underclocked the N4020
processor to 800mhz.

Interestingly, it holds up well enough to perform basic web browsing and pretty
much any CLI workflow without issues. Combined with its relatively alright wifi
card and its actually pretty insane battery capacity, I'm able to use it as a
thin client - running lighter tasks on-laptop, and offloading heavier tasks to
my desktop via SSH/VNC.

Usually, I only use my laptop at school, and it lasts around a week and a half
to two weeks of usage on a single charge. When I'm traveling and using it more
often, I easily get four or five days. Because of this, I can often get away
with not bringing around a charger at all on most trips.

<details><summary>Phone</summary>

I use a jailbroken iphone SE (first generation, from 2016) on iOS 13.4.1.
It has the clang toolchain and SDK installed, so I can (and sometimes do)
code on this device.

It is jailbroken with Odysseyra1n, running the Procursus bootstrap.

I am not that good at Objective-C, but I have written a few tweaks -
for example [radianator](https://github.com/vmhl87/radianator).

I have some old web games on [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/user/250345),
mostly uncompleted.
